      "*MEN looking to take your gf or soon to be gf or wife on a NICE CHEAP DATE? Maggiano's is the place to go ;)  MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT! I come here about at least twice a month and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and their delicious food. Make sure you try their Caesar's salad because they honestly have the BEST Caesar's salad. Everything else I've had on their menu has been phenomenal.   At Maggiano's you're able to substitute or subtract/add items you don't like. They also serve bread so an appetizer isn't needed unless you want to order them.   On weekends, it's probably best if you make a reservation just in case cause they can make you wait 25-35 mins for just 2 people, but they do accept walk-ins as well if you're up for the wait or just in the area.   Average bill for 2 ppl with 2 orders of side Caesar's salad and 2 beverages, excluding alcohol...is roughly $40. That price for good food, fancy looking restaurant and is on the strip is hard to find!\"\t-1.4\tyou got it\t-2\t-1\t0\t1\t2\n",

    "    text = '''Fair is fair, I wrote a terrible review for a Chinese restaurant last week, Now for something completely different...we were in Phoenix on a visit, and after last week's disaster at the Chinese buffet where the food was cold, tough, and tasteless, I figured we couldn't do worse...Yelp helped me find China Chili; with 154 reviews and almost all of them 4 or 5 stars, I figured it was our very best shot at a decent meal.  My standards for Chinese food are very high as I lived in San Francisco for 20 years and have been to China for the real thing; so don't take my 3 star rating as disrespect. It's really quite good, certainly the best Chinese I've had since I left San Francisco.   Dcor usually isn't an important part of the experience for me but China Chili is quite attractive inside, it looks small from the outside but was quite spacious inside. Despite being one very large room it was possible to have a quiet conversation. The lighting is quite relaxing without being dim,  and the dcor traditional Chinese.  We had Hot & Sour soup, and were asked if we wanted it spicy; we did; it was. Really quite excellent, among the best Hot & Sour I've had. Very rich and full, I was surprised at the shrimp and chicken, which were perfect in texture and taste; the veggies were just the right crispness, the broth was spicy but not too hot, and all in all I really recommend this soup; my companion said it was his favorite part of the meal. He's from rural North Carolina and had never had it before, nor much Chinese. As for me, I'd come back for more.  Next up the Kung Pao Chicken was little disappointing, in that it had too little chicken, too much okra. But it's a minor point, the flavor was delicate and pleasant, the mix of other vegetables offset the okra and what chicken there was, was nice. Unfortunately it was not very spicy, especially after the soup, and so if you order it I suggest you ask for it to be extra spicy. But still a pretty decent dish.  My personal favorite of the meal was the Prawns in Lobster Sauce with black beans. Perhaps a little salty but the flavors overall were delicate, the prawns large, tender, and juicy and no hint of greasiness.  Last we had house special fried rice which was excellent, very fluffy and well seasoned, with beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp. Quite gingery which I like.   All in all, while it's not up with the very best Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, the food and service were more than acceptable, prompt, unobtrusive, helpful and the price very reasonable, $40 for four dishes and sodas including tax; and the portions were more than generous, we took home more food than we ate (by intention). The Soup alone could have been half the meal...  If you're in Phoenix and you want Chinese, you couldn't go far wrong by choosing China Chile.'''\n",
