# Overview #
--- 
**Description**: A dashboard showing a live visualisation of students who are joining [SMU Business Intelligence and Analytics Club (SMUBIA)](http://www.smubia.org). The data is obtained directly from Google Sheets, and updated in 5 seconds intervals. This dashboard is mobile friendly and responsive to whatever resolution. This dashboard was shown during Singapore Management University's CCA Fair.

Project Eye' OT is an Internet Of Things (IoT) solution which aims to reduce the number of unreturned trolleys using a low cost and reliable solution. Utilising BLE beacon technology and proximity sensors (Raspberry pi), Eye' OT tracks shopping trolleys and takes actions once it leaves the premises.

**Outcomes:** As a result of the various marketing strategies and this real time dashboard, we have reached a total of 250 member sign ups as a result. 

**Tools Used:** HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java (backend for app), MySQL, D3.js

**Sample Visualisation:** (Original cannot be used due to the requirement with a database) [michaelomh.github.io/Iot_dashboard/](michaelomh.github.io/Iot_dashboard/)
